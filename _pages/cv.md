I am an AI researcher working on deep learning for Earth Observation. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree (MSc) from the Technical University of Munich in  Data Engineering and Analytics, and a Bachelor's degree (BSc) in Computer Science from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Since December 2020, I have been pursuing a PhD within Orion Lab, a research group jointly affiliated with the National Observatory of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens, focusing on Deep Learning for Earth observation.

I have authored publications in top-tier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, ICCV, and AAAI, as well as leading Earth Observation journals including IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing and IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. 

Part of my work was recognized among the Top 100 AI Projects of 2022â€“23 by UNESCOâ€™s International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI).
I received the Beyond Fellowship from the AI4EO Future Lab of the Technical University of Munich and was part of the winning team in the 2024 Cassini Challenge for the idea track.

I have extensive experience with leading research institutions such as Mila â€“ Quebec AI Institute, the National Observatory of Athens, the Technical University of Munich, and the National Technical University of Athens. I have also worked with leading companies, including Esri, and KPIT.
