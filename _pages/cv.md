I am an AI researcher working on deep learning for Earth Observation. I hold a PhD in Computer Science, completed jointly between the Orion Lab of the National Technical University of Athens and Harokopio University of Athens. Additionally I hold a Master of Science from the Technical University of Munich in Data Engineering and Analytics, and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

I have authored publications in top-tier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, ICCV, and AAAI, as well as leading Earth Observation journals including IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing and IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. 

Part of my work was recognized among the Top 100 AI Projects of 2022–23 by UNESCO’s International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI).
I received the Beyond Fellowship from the AI4EO Future Lab of the Technical University of Munich and was part of the winning team in the 2024 Cassini Challenge for the idea track.

I have extensive experience with leading research institutions such as Mila – Quebec AI Institute, the National Observatory of Athens, the Technical University of Munich, and the National Technical University of Athens. I have also worked with leading companies, including Esri, and KPIT.
